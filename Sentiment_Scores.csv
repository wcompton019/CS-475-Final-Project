63,"This little guy came into the compounds of my house a couple of days ago and then decided to move in.I was outside with my cats, just enjoying the afternoon air.I saw him peeking from outside the gate at my cat Angie.Then he saw my foster kittens running around.He jumped inside.He looked harmless and so I let him be.I didn't think he would stick around but I was wrong.He is so very tame and affectionate which causes me to believe that he is someone's cat.But he was so skinny so I suspected that he was lost.The odd thing was that he looked at me like he knew who I was but I have never seen him around before.He even went about approaching my cats like he was family and was none too shy to attempt play with the kittens.It appears to be that he came from a multiple cat household/family.He stayed for 2 days and wouldnt leave.Fearing that someone might be looking for it, my mom and I decided to place him at this one area where we believed he might have originated from (considering several factors) in hopes that he would find his way home.Surprisingly, after a day he found his way back to my house!This prompted me to think that he may have ran away instead of gotten lost because he had found his way back to my place (I took him to that other area by car and at night so he couldn't have known the route- or so I thought).I surely hope that he wasn't abandoned by his previous owner and that is why he refuses to go home.I tried looking around for his owner but nobody seems to know where he came from.He's a very dear and loving cat.Likes to brush against people's legs and is obviously familiar with humans and other pet cats.He's not stunningly beautiful but he's got a soft friendly face and a BIG nose! =p.C'mon, Barbara Streisand has a huge nose and she's adored by many!Since no one has come forward to claim him and he wants to be someone's furkid, I've decided to put him up for adoption to anyone willing to give him a loving home.Unfortunately I cannot keep/foster him myself because I have reached full capacity for cats at my home for the time being.So I do not have the space nor the means to care for him.Adoption fees are for precautionary measures to make sure he doesn't get any joy/irresponsible adopters.He will be vaccinated and dewormed with that money.Strictly for animal lovers only who believe in the act of neutering.IF I can find donations to neuter him first I will do that before he goes to a new home.If not, you must promise to neuter him.He MUST be a FREE ROAMING cat either indoor, outdoor or both.I do not agree in caging animals unless for safety purposes or temporary health issues so if you plan to keep him in a cage 24/7, I'm sorry I will have to say no.Please understand that I will ask questions to see if you are suitable for the cat.It is not that I want to be unreasonable or difficult but I want what is best for the cat.Those interested please contact me preferably through email.Better yet, if this is your cat or you know the owner of this cat please let me know.Hopefully with sound proof that he belongs to you or that someone you know.Thank you.",12.0,0.0

966,"~Update: 27 Nov ~ Fred and Ginger have been neutered and spayed, and are now recuperating from their respective surgeries.Next up is getting them vaccinated and corresponding quarantine period to ensure they're not harbouring any hidden illnesses.They're so far active and healthy, with good appetites.My vet says they are in too good condition to be strays, hence a stronger suspicion that they may have been abandoned.I'm still trying to find them a home where they can be together because they are so attached to each other (we suspect they're siblings), although I am not closed to the idea of getting them adopted separately if really need be.Please do consider adopting them together and give them a second chance at having a family.Adoption conditions: 1.Love them and respect them as you would treat any other person (treat them like how you would like to be treated), provide them access to clean water, healthy food, medical treatments and most of all, give them love and attention.2.A meet-up between potential adopter and the dogs would be recommended so both can meet each other and see if there's chemistry.3.Allow occasional visitations so I may see how the adopter and dogs are doing.This will only be once in a while as I respect your privacy.An adoption fee would apply to cover some of their medical expenses.~Original Post~ I very recently spotted Fred and Ginger near my parents' place.They were not there before, so they must have only just been dumped.Why I suspect that they're dumped pets?They display the following characteristics: 1.They have been in the same spot, out in the open, looking like they're waiting for their owner to return for them.Based on my observation of typical strays, they don't like to be out in the open and prefer to hide, coming out only when they need to look for food.2.They are friendly; they came right up to me when I got down from my car.Again, looking like they were expecting their owner to come pick them up and take them home.They let me pet them and did not shy away from me at all.Typical strays would just run away when I even step out of my car and will only touch the food after I have driven off.The area where they are at is not safe for them because the people there may call the local council to catch them anytime because they are not stray-friendly at all.And given that Fred and Ginger stay out in the open, they make their presence known because people can see them whenever they pass by.I don't know how old they are, I am just guesstimating that they're around 1-2 years old.Please note that they are NOT purebred German Shepherds but they look like they have some mix of GS in them.They are medium sized, with somewhat short legs (reminds me of basset hounds).Put these features together and you get awesomely cute mixed breeds!I am willing to get them neutered, spayed and vaccinated before they go to their new homes.That is what the adoption fee will go towards.Please find it in your heart to give them a second chance at a home.They've already been dumped once (I suspect); please give them a second chance.If possible, do adopt them together because they are such a lovely couple!(see photo) They don't have much time; I would like to get them off the streets as soon as possible before the people call the local council on them.But I can't do it without securing a home for them first because I cannot afford long-term boarding for them.Please contact me at if you're interested.Genuine adopters only.Thank you.Adopt, don't shop.",14.5,0.0

1349,Soya came to my house uninvited one day approximately a year ago and he doesn't want to leave despite numerous efforts by my family members to shoo him away.After awhile I grew very fond of him because he's such a doll and I felt sorry for him for not having a home of his own.He's generally a good cat.Very affectionate and likes to be around people.He'll come running when you call his name.I think he would make a fabulous pet and companion.He is able to co-exist with my female cats without much fuss.The reason why I need to find a new home for him is because he doesn't get along with my male cat.I recently castrated him (my cat) and now Soya bullies him.He is very lovable and loves to be petted.He's not a fussy eater either and makes a good outdoor cat as well as an indoor cat.If you're interested please let me know.But I only want a responsible animal lover and not a so-so owner for him.I need to know that he'll be well cared for and not neglected later on.Edit: Although I think he would do fine indoors but I would like him to have a home where he is allowed access to the outside world.Preferably with a lawn.I have also added some more pictures of him so you can have a better idea of how he looks like.Edit2: The person who decided to take him changed her mind.Soya is still up for adoption.If you feel you can give him a good life please email me or sms me asap.Thank you.,9.7,0.2

1385,"A week ago, I found the cat marred with bleeding flesh wounds all over its body.At that moment of time the cat was still as lively as ever, seemingly ignorant of its injuries.However last wednesday I found the cat lying weak and limping from a seemingly broken paw, although its wounds were beginning to heal slightly.From accounts of some students, some have witnessed the cat being victim to dog attacks.My friend and I got it to the vet in Semenyih, but unfortunately it was closed.We applied iodine onto its wounds, and I kept it in my room for a few days.I took it back home to PJ in the weekends, and sought help.From diagnosis, the cat was probably ran over more than once by vehicles judging from its injuries, and the fracture is more severe than initially thought of.The cat has fractured/dislocated its shoulder, and it has begin to ossify, which means the bone is beginning to heal in an abnormal position.The cat will be lame for the rest of its life if not corrected, and this will render it defenseless as it hinders its movement (it can only hop now, and tends to lose balance and fall).The bone is now jutting out from the side.The vet recommended surgery as its nerve endings are still intact, in which a pin will be placed in the shoulder to help correct it.However, whether the cat will be able to use the leg after surgery will depend on the impact of the surgery on its nerves.If the surgery is performed after the bone heals in that abnormal position, the bone will have to be broken again to insert the pin.The surgery costs more a thousand ringgit.The vet says if surgery is decided against the cat has to be kept indoors as it is unable to protect itself or hunt for food.I am unable to pay for its medical cost due to financial problems.I have been taking care of the cat in my room.I cannot bring the cat back to my house because my dad has suppressed immunity as a result of chemotherapy, and I am beginning to wheeze as I keep the cat in such a confined space.I have brought the cat to PAWS, the most lenient of all animal shelters to see if they can rehome the cat, but according to policy if the cat has a broken leg it will be promptly put to sleep.I hope the students can help the cat out by: 1.Contributing a little to its medical fees 2.Adopt the cat, or at least look after it.The cat is clean, sensible, uses the cat litter well, very sociable and is not hostile towards other cats.It is pretty vocal and clingy though.I really need your help.The photo is a misrepresentation of its injuries, we mistakenly bandaged the paw thinking the paw is fractured.It also hides all its flesh wounds from view.Contact number:",11.5,-0.1

2391,"Lucy is a pregnant stray that I rescued from my condo area in early Oct .The residents' committee rejected my proposal to implement Trap-Neuter-Release-Manage (TNRM) to manage the stray cat population at our condo, and opted instead to engage DBKL to catch them.Working against time, I have trapped and neutered 4 cats, and released them in a nearby kampung with the permission and assistance of the kind gardener at my condo, because we all know what will happen to stray animals when DBKL or other municipal councils get them.Lucy is the 5th cat among those that I've caught and I boarded her at my vet so that she can safely deliver her babies (she was in her late pregnancy when I caught her).Lucy delivered 3 furballs on 18 Oct .They are about 3 weeks old now, 2 light grey ones and a dark grey tabby.Their genders can't be determined yet because they are still so young but do check this space, I will update as soon as we can tell.Lucy will be spayed once her kittens are weaned and she will be up for adoption thereafter.Lucy has a very calm temperament and she's quite docile, so much so that I managed to catch her with no trouble at all.When at the vet for the first time, she was very calm and allowed the vet to examine her without any trouble.I believe she will make a loving pet.I am estimating that she will be ready for adoption around mid-Dec .Lucy's kittens will be up for adoption once they are weaned and gotten their first dose of vaccination, which will be in another estimated 3 weeks.Lucy and her kittens can be adopted individually or together.They are currently boarded at my vet's clinic in Puchong and I can deliver them to their new home within Klang Valley.Conditions for adoption: 1.To be indoor-only cats.This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals.2.Kittens to be spayed/neutered when they are 5-6 months.Those who are interested to adopt the kittens MUST commit to spaying or neutering them when they reach minimum age because this is the only way to control our stray cat population.There will be a RM deposit required for each kitten, which will be refunded upon proof of spaying/neutering. 3.Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary.4.To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress during the first 3 months or until they are spayed/neutered.Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to their adoption: *Lucy: de-flea, deworm, spay and vaccinate *Kittens: de-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population.As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered.Serious adopters only.Kindly contact me via email, SMS or whatsapp if you are interested.I will contact you as soon as I can.Thank you!",7.5,0.1

2416,"In June we found a sad and hungry dog who had a badly injured paw wandering about at Taman Putra, Cheras by the roadside and we knew that we had to do something to help him.He is a good looking and clean dog and we knew he must belong to someone and sure enough we found his fur around his neck was flattened where he had worn a collar for some time.His injury was causing him great pain and we can only assume that his owner abandoned him to avoid costly vet bills.We managed to gain his trust and took him to the vet for treatment.Sadly the vet diagnosed that the injury was too bad to save the leg and amputation was the best option.The newly named &quot;Nolan&quot; went through the operation and recovered amazingly well, in fact the vet told us that after such a major operation he was suprised at how well Nolan has recovered and how healthy he is.Nolan is really happy now that the pain has gone and is very lively and acts and behaves as if 3 legs are better than 4!He tries to show that he can do anything a 4 legged dog can do and do it better!He loves his walks and obviously misses human company as he is always asking for strokes and hugs and giving back kisses and licks.He has gone through an awful lot in his life and after going through so much pain and heartache after being injured and abandoned he really deserves a loving and secure home to live in.He would make a great family pet and would fill any home with love and fun and at the same time still be able to keep it and the family safe and secure!Please, can you consider giving Nolan a second chance and a forever home?I am reacheable via my email or you may contact me at my handset number + .Thank you.",6.4,0.2

3159,"~Night of Rescue - 25 Feb ~ We bumped into Chester while we were walking home from dinner on the night of 25 Feb .He was fearful but hunger got the best of him and he bravely came near us for a bit of my husband's pie.There was a Jaya Grocer nearby so I dashed there and bought 2 pouches of cat food.While he was gobbling up the first packet, my husband ask &quot;So are you going to catch it and get it snipped?Better decide now before it gets full and runs off.&quot;Typically, I don't rescue cats who are not in need of help (i.e. not injured) and I trap-neuter-release stray cats whom I've fed for a while and am familiar with.But Chester seemed manageable to catch so I grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and took him back to our place.~Vet Visit - 27 Feb ~ Took Chester to the vet today, with the intention of getting him neutered.At the beginning, I'd thought Chester was female (I didn't get to check him out closely) so the vet enlightened me and informed me that he's male :PAnd for male cats, it is not recommended to neuter them too early so that their urinary tubes can develop so that they have a lesser chance of getting urinary issues later in life.The vet recommends male cats to be neutered around 10 months or older.This is a new thing I learned today because I'd thought all cats can be neutered from 6 months and above.Well, it can be done, just not recommended.(Note: The urinary issue does not affect female cats) Chester is estimated to be about 5 months old now.Unfortunately, I can't keep him for another 5 months before getting him neutered.So I am boarding him at the vet for the next 2 weeks to try to find him a home, failing which, I will neuter him and release him.Chester is not an aggressive cat.He is fearful of strangers and hisses, which is totally normal, but he does not bite or scratch.Once you softly pat his head, he calms down and stops hissing.Conditions for adoption: 1.Ideally to be an indoor-only cat.This is to prevent any unfortunate incidents like being hit by vehicles or attacked by humans or other animals.2.Commit to neuter him at 10 months.Those who are interested to adopt Chester MUST commit to neuter him because this is the only way to control our stray cat population.It also prevents him from spraying around your house and prevents certain health conditions (Google on benefits of neutering cats).3.Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary.4.To be willing to provide regular updates on his progress until he is neutered.Procedures to be taken care of by me prior to Chester's adoption: De-flea, deworm, vaccinate (1st dose) I cannot stress enough the importance of neutering and spaying of pets to prevent unwanted litters and ultimately, controlling the stray population.As such, only potential adopters who believe in spaying/neutering their pets OR those who are willing to learn about spaying/neutering will be considered.Serious adopters only.Kindly contact me via email, SMS or whatsapp if you are interested.I will contact you as soon as I can.Thank you!*Adopt, never buy.Save a life today* *Love needs no pedigree*",9.7,0.0
